# Signature Pieces
- Install packages.
- Run mongod.
- Go to port 3000.
- Create your masterpieces. (Unfortunately, you cannot save them, yet!)

## Aside

Originally, I wanted to create an application that would allow users to create and share "Signature Pieces." The application was going to have a variety of features, from increasing and decreasing brush sizes to selecting various outlines in which to color. However, time was not in my corner. 

I began this project with little time. At the onset, I was excited and ready to create my vision, but an overwhelming feeling of meeting the d(r)eadline replaced that former notion. 

Regardless, I already have ideas and ways in which to improve this application. Moreover, I want to establish a firm grasp on DRY techniques, as well as bolster my JavaScript knowledge--and learn so much more! 

Despite its lack of my original vision, I am happy with the outcome; after all, I began this journey in May 2016 with zero coding experience.

Never stop learning.
